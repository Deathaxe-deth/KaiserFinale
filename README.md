# KaiserFinale

My goal was basically make an interactive music program with the fun wizard speaking wizard. I didn't exactly reach my vision mainly because it's too ambitious for my skill. But there were a few goals I met and that's enough to satisfy me. One of which is the randomization of the wizards dialouge. 

The Main challenge is the limitations that I have to deal with. Like trying to get the sequencer to move down a bit which took way too long to figure out. Another issue it has is sometimes the sequencer isn't exactly consistent with speed so it jitters a bit. One more is that it doesn't activate until you press the button. So I stated that you should press A to trigger it to work. Why it's doing that is beyond me.

So overall. I'd say it's good for some quick fun. It contains like I said, a sequencer which you can make melodies. The button which is interactable with both mouse click on the button or the keyboard plays a variety of interesting drumlike sounds that can help make a beat. There is a play and stop button. and of course, the wizard. If I were to add/change anything. I would maybe try to add some effects to make things more dynamic and interesting
